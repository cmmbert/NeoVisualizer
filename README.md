# NeoVisualizer
For this assignment I browsed the list of APIs provided by our teachers and picked one out that sparked my interest. 

In my case this was the NASA api that holds information about NEOs (Near Earth Objects)

https://api.nasa.gov/neo/rest/v1/neo/
 
## Main overview
You can easily switch between an offline repository and the online api by clicking the button in the top left.
You can navigate the pages easily by either using the 'previous' and 'next' buttons or alternatively typing in the desired page number and pressing enter.

Click on a NEO in the main list page to view the details page.

## Details
The details page shows some extended information which includes all of the approaches the object has had and will have in the future.

Furthermore, it has an approximation of its size visualized using spheres
